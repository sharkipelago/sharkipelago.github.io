## Initial Ring - OG16
* * *
This is the initial ring with the 16 players who signed up by the deadline.

## Late 5 Ring
* * *
5 players (Alexa, Ezgi, Connor, Michelle, and Clarissa) signed up after the deadline. They were chained together to create 1 unit that could be slotted in anywhere in the ring. After Stella killed Hank, instead of getting Hank's target (Jolinna), Stella was assigned to the tail of that chain (Alexa), while the head of the chain (Ezgi) was assigned to Jolinna. 
Essentially:
Chain = Alexa -> ... -> Ezgi
Original Ring = Stella -> Hank -> Jolinna
_Hank Dies_
Stella -> Alexa -> ... ->  Ezgi -> Jolinna

Because they were able to avoid any conflict that happened in the first 4 days, the late 5 also received punishments if they couldnâ€™t make a kill by a certain deadline. 
None of them made a kill by this deadline.
Alexa, Ezgi, and Connor had a slightly shorter deadline and received the punishment of having an additional assassin tracking them down.
Clarissa and Michelle had a slightly longer deadline and received the punishment of becoming celebrity assassins.

There were different ideas for assigning additional assassins to the first 3, but ultimatley, they were scrapped, because there were already a lot of extra rules and roles. The first three were falsely notified that they had an extra assassin. However, all other times players were notified that they had an extra assassin, or similar information was legit. 

In retrospect, especially since the first 3's punishment wasn't real Clarissa and Michelle's punishment was way worse and would probably be handled differently if it could be redone.

## Taco Friday

Summary of Taco Friday for anyone not present. 

The final 3 were led to the rotunda while all the defenders (non-players and dead players) were at South Lawn. Defenders were given the following map and instructed that the final 3 would show up somewhere around the blue rectangle.

The final 3 players were instructed to retrieve various corpses (water bottles with socks on them) and come back to the Rotunda. They were given the following map marking the locations of the corpses.

After the first player returned to the Rotunda with a corpse, a 5-minute countdown would start, and the player who recovered the most corpses that came back within the countdown would've won.

Additionally, 
- An extra defender (Sebastian) was released 2 minutes after the final player left the rotunda. Sebastian was also given the player map and allowed to communicate with other defenders but could not show the map to anyone else
- The final 3 were allowed to kill each other but defenders were immune to death
- The map was rather large
- It was dark and raining
- Alexa's phone died almost immediately after the start

This made the challenge difficulty increase, and as a result no player made it back to the Rotunda, Alexa won by being the last player standing
